// EVMApplyTransaction is a vendored version of go-ethereum's unexported applyTransaction method (not to be confused
// with the exported method ApplyTransaction). This method was vendored to simply be exposed/exported, so it can be
// used by the test chain. This method offers greater control of parameters over the exposed ApplyTransaction
// method. Its purpose is to take a message (internal transaction) and apply state transition updates to our current
// state as if we had just previously received and validated a transaction which the message was derived from.
// This executes on an underlying EVM and returns a transaction receipt, or an error if one occurs.
