# CLI Overview

The `medusa` CLI is used to perform parallelized fuzz testing of smart contracts. After you have `medusa`
[installed](../getting_started/installation.md), you can run `medusa help` in your terminal to view the available commands.

The CLI supports three main commands with each command having a variety of flags:

- [`medusa init`](./init.md)
- [`medusa fuzz`](./fuzz.md)
- [`medusa completion`](./completion.md)
