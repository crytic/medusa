## Tips for Testing with Medusa

### General

- **Use multiple testing modes:** Medusa supports property testing, assertion testing, and optimization testing. Use a combination of modes to thoroughly test your contracts.
- **Write clear and concise tests:** Your tests should be easy to read and understand. Avoid complex logic or unnecessary code.
- **Test edge cases:** Consider testing extreme values and unusual inputs to ensure your contracts handle them correctly.
- **Use a variety of test inputs:** Generate a diverse set of test inputs to cover a wide range of scenarios.
- **Monitor gas consumption:** Medusa can track gas consumption during testing. Use this information to identify areas where your contracts can be optimized.

### Property Testing

- **Choose meaningful properties:** The properties you test should be important invariants of your contract.

### Assertion Testing

- **Use assertions judiciously:** Assertions can be useful for catching errors, but they can also slow down testing. Use them only when necessary.
- **Test for both valid and invalid inputs:** Ensure your assertions check for both valid and invalid inputs to thoroughly test your contract's behavior.
- **Use pre-conditions and post-conditions to verify the state of the contract before and after a function call.:** Pre-conditions and post-conditions are assertions that can be used to verify the state of the contract before and after a function call. This can help to ensure that the function is called with the correct inputs, that it produces the expected outputs, and that the state of the contract is valid.

### Optimization Testing

- **Choose a meaningful optimization goal:** The goal of your optimization test should be to maximize a specific metric, such as the return value of a function.
- **Use a variety of optimization techniques:** Medusa supports multiple optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing. Consider using different techniques to find the best solution.

### Additional Tips

- **Use a configuration file:** A configuration file allows you to customize Medusa's behavior and specify additional testing parameters.
- **Use corpus and coverage information to improve the effectiveness of your fuzzing campaigns:** Corpus and coverage information can be used to improve the effectiveness of your fuzzing campaigns by providing feedback on the quality of the test inputs.
- **Run Medusa in parallel:** Medusa can run tests in parallel to speed up the testing process.
- **Review the test results carefully:** Medusa provides detailed test results. Take the time to review them carefully and identify any potential issues.
- **Use Medusa as part of your development process:** Integrate Medusa into your development workflow to regularly test your contracts and identify potential bugs early on.
